</--# hello-world-->
</-- My first repository and hopefully the first of many. -->
</-- I currently work in the oil and gas industry, and I am looking to transition to a career in computer science. I feel that this transition matches closely with current job market trends and it also suits my personal agenda. I have some previous C++ experience from a brief encounter in a degree in engineering course and I'd like to learn more as fast as possible. -->
